# [GraphQl-NetFlix-DGS](https://github.com/sha1shwat/GraphQl-NetFlix-DGS)

This shows a good example of GraphQL API using annotation based **NETFLIX DGS**.<br>
NETFLIX Dgs is a open source framework developed by Netflix, built on the top of graphql-java-tools.<br>
Dgs makes query and mutation quite easy and also provide support for fedration .

## Features

- Query and Mutation process.
- Nested query in GraphQL
- Introspection i.e schema evolution
- DataLoaders i.e how to resolve **N+1 problem**
- Context Builder property which solves the **problem of overfetching**
- Querying another api , somewhat similar to schema stiching.<br> Tried to resolve problem for fedration/stiching for Java language which is only possible with node.js
